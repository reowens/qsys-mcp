## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Richer package description + expanded npm keywords, and added GitHub repo
  description + topics, for search and discoverability.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- No functional changes. First release cut through the GitHub Actions
  trusted-publishing pipeline (OIDC, no token) — published with build
  provenance. `0.1.0` was a manual bootstrap publish.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Initial release: an MCP server that controls Q-SYS over the QRC protocol
  (JSON-RPC 2.0 over TCP 1710), pointed at a real Core or at Q-SYS Designer in
  Emulate mode.
- 13 tools — connect, status, component/control discovery, get/set for both
  Named Controls and component controls (with ramps), change groups
  (create / poll / add-component / destroy), and disconnect.
- Response shaping (`filter`, `names_only`, `type`) to keep large designs from
  flooding an agent's context.
- Live-Core write warning and a 30 s NoOp keepalive.
- Cross-platform CI (Linux / macOS / Windows × Node 18 & 20) with a
  hardware-free test suite (mock QRC + in-memory MCP transport).
